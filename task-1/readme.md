# Task 1

Script 1 : Develop a bash script to find all the login attempts and print out the day of the login attempt and the IP address of the user's in the format below. 

`On 16/Feb/2020, a login attempt was made, with the request coming from the IP 194.156.95.20`

Script 2 : Write a bash script to find and print out unique IP addresses

Script 3 : Create a bash script that takes an IP address as input and prints out all of the requests made by that specific IP address.

What to do is outlined below:

- ðŸ‘‰ Fork the repository from here  https://github.com/gtechatfg/mulearn-cybersecurity-cohort1
- ðŸ‘‰ You can find 3 files in the repository `access.log`, `Participant-list.xlsx` and a directory `task-1`
- ðŸ‘‰ Use the `access.log` file as the program's input
- ðŸ‘‰ Create a directory using your team number as the name inside task-1 directory; you can find your team number in the `Participant-list.xlsx` , for example `team-1` where `1` should be changed in respective of your team number
- ðŸ‘‰ A sample script that filters out IP from the log file can be found in the team-0 directory; use it as a reference
- ðŸ‘‰ Push the script to GitHub in such a way that each team has its own sub-directory; otherwise, it will not be accepted
- ðŸ‘‰ Make a pull request to the source repository; we will use this pull request to evaluate your code.
For someone with prior experience, this would be a simple task; however, if you are unable to crack it right away, take your time, do more research, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any doubts. 
I hope you would enjoy this task.

Task points will be assigned based on the code's readability; it is preferable if every team member contributes. Because this is a group activity, it would be better if you could collaborate by meeting in person or virtually for a better outcome.

**The deadline for submitting the task is Monday, 11:59 PM. IST**

You can also post images of your group meetups here.


    NB: Keep in mind that this is not your typical collage assignment; 
        instead, submit your own collaborative work;
        plagiarism and copycat's will not be tolerated.
